### Fast intelligence analysis HW/SW Engine Exploiting IoT Platform for Boosting On-device AI in 5G Environment [11/05/2020 - Current]
Develop On-device IoT high-speed intelligent HW and SW engine that improves the speed and precision of intelligent analysis of large scale streamed sensor data through spatio-temporal context feedback.

* Role
  * Verify the feasibility and usability of developed services in the 5G enviromnents
  * Space-time domain available context and analysis research
  * Research on how to use existing context information model

### Autonomous Management framework based on artificial intelligent Technology for adaptive and disposable IoT [07/08/2018 - Current]
Development of disposable IoT core technology that can be used for one time during the service request time through optimal management of resources even in environments where it is difficult to obtain detailed sensing of physical space and collection through microminiaturization and low cost of IoT devices

 * Role:
   * Design and standardization of information models for managing disposable IoT terminals, systems, and applications in Edge/Fog environments
   * Development of ID processing technology when reusing disposable IoT devices


### Synchronicity [25/06/2018 - 29/02/2020]
Secure smart city data by operating real smart city test bed using IoT technologies Constructing the smart city data market based on the stored data from smart cities.

 * Role:
   * Using deep learning and image processing technology to check the parking status
   * Deliver the results to the IoT platform and use the information for supporting the web/apps


### An open source oneM2M conformance testing tool project [22/02/2017 - 16/05/2018]
oneM2MTester project is an oneM2M conformance testing project which was initialized by Korea Electronics Technology Institute (KETI) in January 2016. The project aims to develop and distribute an open source oneM2M conformance testing tool and associated user manuals. Currently, this tool is introduced as a useful opensource project in oneM2M (http://onem2m.org/developers-corner/tools/open-source-projects)

 * Role:
   * oneM2MTester main contributor.
   * The TTCN-3 based oneM2M testing code verification which is being developed by ETSI.
   * Cooperation with external organizations such as TTA, ETSI, and Ericsson to develop oneM2M testing tool.


### Wolrdwide interobability for semantics IoT (Wise-IoT) [14/02/2016 - 23/02/2018]
Wise-IoT is a collaboration project between Europe and Korea. It aims at deepening the interoperability and interworking of IoT's existing systems. The project uses the experiences available in the consortium to build a comprehensive mediation framework that can be used between various IoT systems.

  * Role:
    * Analyzing the oneM2M and FIWARE IoT standard
    * Developing the Interworking Proxy Entity (IPE) for oneM2M-FIWARE interworking
